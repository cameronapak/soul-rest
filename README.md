# Soul Rest

## The Heart

I battle a lot of anxiety and depression. Christian meditation has helped me find rest in the chaos.

There are great faith-based apps out there. But for creators—especially new ones who've been sharing content on YouTube or elsewhere—getting a seat at the table means building your own app. That costs money. That's hard. And it feels like you're competing instead of answering a calling.

Soul Rest gives Christian creatives who make prayer meditative content a place to share what God has put on their hearts. No app to build. No barriers to entry. Just create and share.

For listeners, the invitation is simple: Find Soul Rest.

## The Vision

A community-driven platform where approved publishers submit Christian prayer meditation content (audio files or YouTube links). Users browse and play. That's the start.

Open source. Built for creators. Made for rest.
